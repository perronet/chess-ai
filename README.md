# Chess AI

My first AI project, where I trained a neural network to play chess starting from a dataset of chess positions pre-evaluated by Stockfish (currently the top chess engine).

## Quick start

`make all` will convert the dataset, train the neural network, and launch the UI to play chess (`pychess`).
